# Custom Interpreted Programming Language (Dawn)
 
This is a high-level interpreted programming language called Dawn, designed by myself and two of my peers. My peers and I designed Dawn with the goal of making programming accessible and unintimidating for beginner programmers. Inspired by the idea of making programming more accesseable, Dawn uses natural, English-like syntax to prioritize readability and ease of use.

By simplifying complex programming concepts and eliminating barriers, Dawn can help users focus on understanding foundational coding principles rather than memorizing intricate rules. This makes it an ideal language for beginners.
